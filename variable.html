	//Happy Path - Declaring a couple of variable, some with numbers and others with strings of text.  I add some of the variables within another variable and then write that variable to the screen.
		var a1 = 3;
		var b1 = 6;
		var c1 = " this is the sum of the two variables";
		var d1;

		document.write(d1);
	//Result - The variables that I asked to be written were with the desired content within them.

	//Nasty Path - I put an = sign inbetween the first var and the variable a2
		//var = a2 = 3;
		var a2 = 3;
		var b2 = 6;
		var c2 = " this is the sum of the two variables";

		document.write(d2);
	//Result - All of the text on the page vanished so I commented it out.  I then readded the variable below the comment because the rest of the examples after example 1 vanished.

	//Nasty Path - I turned the variable b into a string
		var a3 = 3;
		var b3 = "6";
		var c3 = " this is the sum of the two variables";
		var d3;

		d3 = a3 + b3 + c3;

		document.write(d3);
	//Result - It was not added on as a number anymore but as a character.

	//Nasty Path - I took away the quotes from the string variable c
		var a4 = 3;
		var b4 = 6;
		//var c4 = this is the sum of the two variables;
		var c4 = " this is the sum of the two variables";

		document.write("<br><h4>Example 4</h4>" + a4 + " is the first variable.<br>" + b4 + " is the second variable.<br><br>")
		document.write(d4);
	//Result - All of the text on the page vanished.  I commented out that line and then the rest of the functions after that line did not work.  So I added back in the correct code under the comment.

	//Nasty Path - I took away line 63 where variable d was declared
		var a5 = 3;
		var b5 = 6;
		var c5 = " this is the sum of the two variables";
		

		d5 = a5 + b5 + c5;

		document.write("<br><h4>Example 5</h4>" + a5 + " is the first variable.<br>" + b5 + " is the second variable.<br><br>")
		document.write(d5);
	//Result - nothing happened, everything ran as it did before.
