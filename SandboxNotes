-- Brother Barney notes on what to inlcude in our sandoboxes

--HTM5 Video/Audio/Canvas

Video & Audio:
Only need to use mp4 and mp3
	What if the source is an empty string
	What if the source tag is completely missing
	What if the source is pointing to a word file/different file
	What if you passed NULL
Canvas:
	.moveTo / .lineTo null
	.getContext() - try something other than "2d"
	.fillText / .strokeText - draw a keyword
	color stops - pass a number instead of a color
	drawImg -try coping a video
- there are a lot of methods used when working with canvas. 
Throw in as manny funny parameters as you can.


--JSON Parse

Be sure to include what happens if you parse an object and stringify a string

--Arrays

Ideas on things that I should be changing - Push, pop, ship, unshift  array method (pop on empty array, push null)
